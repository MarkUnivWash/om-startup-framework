# Why is it called Om StartUp Framework?

Few months ago, I read a book by Om Swami named "If Truth Be Told: A Monk's Memoir".

It deeply inspired me, so I decided to dedicate this framework to Om Swami. This is why I named the framework after him, as a way to saying Thank you to Om Swami.

Dhanyawad!
