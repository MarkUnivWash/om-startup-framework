# Introduction
_Om Startup Framework by Chetan Jain and Omkar Team_

**üöÄ Save Months of Development Time ‚ú®**
 
## üí° Idea

üôè Namaste, 

A few months back, I built my startup, **omkar.cloud**. Like building all startups, it was a heck of an experience. I spent a few weeks implementing the authentication system, as online resources on JWT were scattered and confusing. I then had to spend a few more days implementing Google authentication. Next, I spent several weeks iterating on the creation of a blog, landing page, pricing page, contact us page, email sending ability, and Google Analytics. Fairly obvious progress. Isn't it?

Well, Reflecting on my experience, I realized that I had spent a lot of time doing things that are fairly common across all SaaS, such as authentication, blog, landing, pricing, and contact us pages. 

I thought to myself, "Why not take features that are common across SaaS and present them into an easy-to-use framework so that developers can save months of development time?"

Well, my thoughts translated into action and I created Om Startup Framework. I am confident that it will save you months of development time and you will love it.


## ‚ú® Benefits

Here are some of the features that will reduce your development time in months so you can be ready to launch your startup from day 1:

In short, Om Startup Framework does all the boring work and all you have to do is fit in the Code that makes your Application Unique. 

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Technologies

Om Startup Framework helps you create Enterprise Level Application. To do so we need to use a number of technologies. Here's a quick taste of the technologies that Om Startup Framework uses:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Elastic UI](https://elastic.github.io/eui/)
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com//)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)


:::info note

Also you can use the framework perfectly well even if you don't know Docker, Kubernetes and Github Actions as these are related to Deployment and already configured for you.

## üìö Pre-Requisite Knowledge

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Next.js and Django. 


Given that you know React, If you are interested to learn Next.js and Django, these resources are Great Starting Point:

- **Next.js**:  [Next.js Documentation \[Free\]](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) 
- **Django**:  [Mosh Hamedani Django Course \[Paid\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHux0gMZ3Eg&pp=ygUMZGphbmdvIG1vc2gg) 

<!-- 
## How it works
An Om application is split into 5 folders: frontend, backend, blog, k8s .github.

**frontend**
The frontend uses Next.js framework, Elastic UI and Tailwind Css. It has Pages for authentication, pricing, landing, user dashboard, url shortner, affiliate system etc. 

**backend**
The backend uses Django framework and provides backend functionality to support authentication, pricing, landing, user dashboard, url shortner, affiliate system etc. pages. It also use SQLite Database be default.

**blog**
The Blog is a Next.js based Blog created using blogging template of [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog by Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

**k8s** 
We use Kubernetes to deploy application. By the way you don't need to know Kubernetes or Docker as it is already configured for you.


**.github** 
It containg Github Action YAML file to delpoy application to Kubernetes on push. Again you do not need to know Github Action as it is already configured for you. -->

## Why is it called Om Startup Framework?
_(A history, by Chetan Jain)_

I am vey inspired by Om Swami. A millionaire tured Monk. I wanted to tell as many people about him as possible. What better way to tell than naming a framework after him. 

So, I decided to create a framework in his name. So a lot of people know about him and benefit from reading books he has written. 

I suggest reading his memoir by downloading pdf at this [link](https://oceanofpdf.com/authors/om-swami/pdf-epub-if-truth-be-told-a-monks-memoir-download/)

I can gurantee that this read will be worth your time in gold.
