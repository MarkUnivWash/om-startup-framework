## Supported Features

Pricing page offers several features such as:

- **WhatsApp Us Button**: We have included a WhatsApp Us button on our pricing page. This allows you to directly reach out to our support team through WhatsApp for any inquiries.

- **Variable Pricing**: Our pricing model incorporates variable pricing based on the location of our customers. For instance, a person in the United States may see a higher price of $25, while a person in Bharat (India) would see a price of Rs 810 ($10). By implementing variable pricing, we can cater to different markets and increase revenue.

- **FAQ**: We have included a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section on our pricing page. 


## Configuration

To customize the variable pricing for different countries or FAQs, you can edit the code` pricing.tsx` file.
