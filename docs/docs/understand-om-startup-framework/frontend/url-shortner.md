## Usecases 

- If you want to track link clicks in your email and marketing campaigns, it is more professional to use "https://yourdomain.com/l/visit-us/" instead of "https://bit.ly/qwrnff/".

- When you want people to book a meeting with you, it is more professional to send a link like "https://yourdomain.com/l/meet-yourname/" rather than "https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/meet-yourname".
