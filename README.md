# Om Startup Framework
_Om Startup Framework by Chetan Jain and Omkar Team_

**üöÄ Save Months of Development Time ‚ú®**
 
## üí° Idea

üôè Namaste, 

A few months back, I built my startup, **omkar.cloud**. Like building all startups, it was a heck of an experience. I spent a few weeks implementing the authentication system, as online resources on JWT were scattered and confusing. I then had to spend a few more days implementing Google authentication. Next, I spent several weeks iterating on the creation of a blog, landing page, pricing page, contact us page, email sending ability, and Google Analytics. Fairly obvious progress. Isn't it?

Well, Reflecting on my experience, I realized that I had spent a lot of time doing things that are fairly common across all SaaS, such as authentication, blog, landing, pricing, and contact us pages. 

I thought to myself, "Why not take features that are common across SaaS and present them into an easy-to-use framework so that developers can save months of development time?"

Well, my thoughts translated into action and I created Om Startup Framework. I am confident that it will save you months of development time and you will love it.

## ‚ú® Benefits

## How it works
An Om application is split into 5 folders: frontend, backend, blog, k8s .github.

**frontend**
The frontend uses Next.js framework, Elastic UI and Tailwind Css. It has Pages for authentication, pricing, landing, user dashboard, url shortner, affiliate system etc. 

**backend**
The backend uses Django framework and provides backend functionality to support authentication, pricing, landing, user dashboard, url shortner, affiliate system etc. pages. It also use SQLite Database be default.

**blog**
The Blog is a Next.js based Blog created using blogging template of [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog by Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

**k8s** 
We use Kubernetes to deploy application. By the way you don't need to know Kubernetes or Docker as it is already configured for you.


**.github** 
It containg Github Action YAML file to delpoy application to Kubernetes on push. Again you do not need to know Github Action as it is already configured for you. -->

## Why is it called Om Startup Framework?
_(A history, by Chetan Jain)_

I am vey inspired by Om Swami. A millionaire tured Monk. I wanted to tell as many people about him as possible. What better way to tell than naming a framework after him. 

So, I decided to create a framework in his name. So a lot of people know about him and benefit from reading books he has written. 

I suggest reading his memoir by downloading pdf at this [link](https://oceanofpdf.com/authors/om-swami/pdf-epub-if-truth-be-told-a-monks-memoir-download/)

I can gurantee that this read will be worth your time in gold.
